Tic-Tac-Toe AI
This Python program is an implementation of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game with an intelligent AI opponent. It allows you to play the game against a computer opponent that uses the minimax algorithm for decision-making.

Key Features:
Graphical User Interface: The game provides a user-friendly interface built with the Pygame library, featuring a 3x3 grid for making moves.

Game Logic: Players can take turns making moves, and the program handles game logic, including win and draw conditions.

AI Opponent: The AI opponent uses the minimax algorithm to calculate the best move for the computer player (Player O). It aims to win or prevent the opponent from winning.

End Game Messages: When the game ends, messages are displayed to announce the winner (Player X, Player O, or a draw).

Replay and Quit Options: Players have the choice to replay the game or exit the program, enhancing the user experience.

User Interaction: The program responds to user input through mouse clicks and keyboard inputs for replay and quit actions.

AI Intelligence: The AI opponent is designed to provide a challenging game, making strategic moves to achieve victory or block the opponent from winning.

This project is both educational and fun, offering an engaging way to play Tic-Tac-Toe against a computer opponent with a competitive edge. It can be used as a learning resource or as a foundation for expanding the game's features and complexity.

Get ready to enjoy the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game with a twist â€“ play against an AI that's always up for a challenge!
